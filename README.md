# Projet_Braceloc_GPSE_Polytech

The GitHub repository contains all the necessary documents, files, and resources to replicate the project.

# Introduction
This project embodies a fusion of technology and practicality to ensure safety and connectivity for individuals in various outdoor scenarios, such as hiking in remote areas, school outings, or even leisure activities like mushroom foraging in dense forests.

These bracelets, when paired, allow users within a group to share and track each other's locations in real-time, even in the most challenging environments where traditional network signals fail.

Braceloc leverages state-of-the-art GPS technology embedded in wearable bracelets. Our vision is to provide peace of mind and enhance safety for our users, enabling them to locate their friends, family, or any group member instantly over considerable distances.

### Braceloc Firmware

### Overview

This repository hosts the device firmware for the Braceloc project, an innovative LoRa-based mesh network solution designed to enhance localization and communication capabilities in remote and challenging environments. The Braceloc firmware enables devices to maintain connectivity over extended distances with minimal power consumption, leveraging the unique properties of LoRa technology to facilitate reliable and secure communication.

### Features

- **Long Range Communication**: Utilizes LoRa technology to ensure robust communication over kilometers without the need for traditional network infrastructure.
- **Mesh Networking**: Employs a self-healing, self-configuring mesh network that increases redundancy and resilience.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimized for low power consumption to extend the battery life of wearable and portable devices.
- **Security**: Implements end-to-end encryption to safeguard data integrity and privacy during transmission.
- **Scalability**: Designed to seamlessly integrate a growing number of devices without significant impact on network performance.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Braceloc firmware:

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mickael458/Braceloc-mesh-.git

**Install the required libraries:**

Detailed steps to install each library are provided in the Installation section.
Configure your devices:
